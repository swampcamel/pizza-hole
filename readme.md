## Description

_This site was created to explore objects, constructors, and key value pairs.  The site imitates a pizza order page where different form options are stored in a Pizza object.  The elements of the pizza object are examined by the backend to determine a price for the custom-built pizza._

## Project Specifications

_User is presented with an interface that offers various pizza options._

_User can select different options for the crust and size and multiple options for toppings._

_A cart area displays the customer's order after clicking on Add to Cart button._

_Cart area displays total cost of all pizza selections_

_User can order multiple pizzas_

_All pizzas ordered are displayed in a clickable list to the user_

_User can enter an address for delivery_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_ES6 compatible browser required to view_
_Must have local versions of Materialize, jQuery and Google Font families to run offline_


## Known Bugs // Future Updates

- [ ] _Add tiebreaker scenario_

- [ ] _Add reset board button_

_Add Player Name inputs to display on win_
_Hide game board until submit on Player Name inputs, and hide inputs on submit_

- [ ]_Figure out a true center on columns with materialize or bootstrap? Not possible...?_
_Because columns are floated in order to make the divs display next to each other.  Not using Materialize/Bootstrap container/row/columns and constructing this from scratch using strict positioning would improve UI balance.  Center can be feigned in M/BS with even columns using offsets with offset-s4 or similar._

_Add Game Mode Option at Input Screen: Play 1D Tic-Tac-Toe (just set all gamesquares to one row)_
